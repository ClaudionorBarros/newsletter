{"name":"PHP Newsletter","tagline":"Web application for newsletter campaign management.","body":"## Introduction\r\n\r\nThis is a very simple and light-weight application for newsletter campaign \r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nIt is studied to be integrated with other existing websites / web applications, so the installation is really straightforward.\r\n\r\n## Installation - 3 easy steps\r\n\r\n1. Upload everything in a subfolder of your web server (i.e. `/newsletter`);\r\n2. Create the database (you can find the schema in the `/db` directory);\r\n3. Modify the `config.php` file to fit your needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage and Features\r\n\r\nTo get started, you can navigate through `quick.php`. This is the page from \r\nwhere you can send newsletters by just following 3 easy steps. So, if your\r\nwebsite is `www.example.com` and you installed this application under a \r\n`newsletter` folder, you can go to:\r\n`http://www.example.com/newsletter/quick.php`.\r\nPlease note that the root folder is intended to be **not accessible** \r\nby design. This way you shouldn't even need to have an authentication system!\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery newsletter has an **HTML template**, that you should create before creating\r\nthe newsletter itself. Instead you can use the default template. All templates\r\nare stored in the database. When you create a new template, you can see a nice\r\nHTML editor with a preview that automatically gets updated every time you edit\r\nthe code.\r\n\r\n**Placeholders** are available during the template creation: you can inflate the\r\nusers' name and email directly into the markup, among with the site name, URL,\r\nthe current date and other.\r\n\r\nA newsletter can have **resources** attached: they're usually just **images** \r\n(jpg, png or gif format). These images are treated as **web bugs** (also known as\r\n[web beacons: you can read more about them in my blog](http://simonewebdesign.it/blog/how-to-create-web-bug-aka-beacon-image/)). This means that the images\r\nyou upload will be used to track users' behavior. You will know exactly who \r\nopened the newsletter, the time and how many times it has been viewed (or, in\r\nother words, *requested*) by every\r\nsingle user.\r\n\r\nAnother cool feature is that you can manage as many **mailing lists** as you want:\r\nevery user will belong to a single mailing list.\r\n\r\nMailing lists can be updated very easily by just copy pasting the addresses in a\r\ntext field and pressing the update button. If you prefer you can always add one\r\nuser at a time. Beware that when you delete a list, all users associated to that\r\nlist will be automatically deleted too.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
